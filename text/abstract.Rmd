Cancer is a disease of cellular metabolism and other basic biochemical processes
common to all cells. However, molecular signatures remain largely
indistinguishable from tissue-of-origin, and general, unifying principles remain
obscure. To address this challenge, we reduced mutation data to disruptions in a
select set of pathways pointing to basic cell biology, from DNA replication to
cellular communication. Using dimension reduction techniques, we assigned tumor
samples into twelve classes distinct from their tissues-of-origin and largely
free of bias from mutational burden or clinical stage. We showed that these
tumor classes vary in prognosis by modeling relative risk of death in different
classes and cancer types. We identified class-specific mutations in different
tissues, demonstrating how tissue-specific signatures contribute to common
cellular phenotypes. Moreover, germline risk mutations involved in genome
stability, such as BRCA1 and Rb1, are equally distributed among our classes,
somewhat contrary to the expectation that such genes are hallmarks of molecular
subtypes. We also investigated pathways that distinguish between metastatic and
non-metastatic tumors, and found that most meaningful differences are
class-specific. Most metastatic enriched pathways from one class in metastatic
tumors are class-specific pathways from another class, suggesting phenotypic
convergence, and potentially highlighting key pathways to focus on
therapeutically for prevention of class-specific relapse. In summary, our
observations suggest that some genes act as drivers of genome instability in all
classes, while different sets of class-specific genes confer increased fitness
in a combinatorial fashion, eventually converging on one or more end-stage
disease phenotypes. Thus, we present a coherent picture of global tumor biology,
and explain how common cellular dysfunction might arise from tissue-specific
mutations.
