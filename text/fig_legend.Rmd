**Figure 1: Molecular pathway profiles of tumor samples with one or more mutations.** 
Each of 377 selected Reactome pathways (columns) is classified as disrupted if
one or more genes is mutated in the tumor sample (rows) where red and grey
represents the pathway is mutated and not, respectively. Tumors are grouped by
tissue of origin using standardized abbreviations from the TCGA project.

**Figure 2: Method for tumor classification using pathway aberration data** 
a) MCA analysis was performed to determine the eigenvalue with the most
explanatory power from the categorical data. Average of 100 permutations of the
data was used as a baseline. b) The p-value of each eigenvalue was plotted and
the max eigenvalue with a pvalue < 0.05 was selected. c) The resulting MCA was
projected down to 3 dimensions for the purpose of density based clustering (only
the first 2 dimensions are shown). Each dot represents a tumor d) HDBSCAN was
used to perform hierarchical density based clustering tuned to minimize the
fraction of unassigned tumors. e) HDBSCAN clustered tumors were visualized on
the UMAP projection; tumors are colored by cluster membership (see legend). This
results in some tumors remaining unclassified (grey points). f) kNN was used to
assign membership to the remaining tumors.

**Figure 3: Pathway-based classification is independent of tissue-of-origin features.** 
a) Projection of cancer type identity onto UMAP. Abbrevs: BRCA = Breast cancer,
COAD = Colorectal adenocarcinoma, HNSC = Head and neck squamous cell, PAAD =
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma. b) Projection of breast cancer subtypes onto the
UMAP. c) Projection of BRCA1/2 somatic mutation onto the UMAP. d) Projection of
tumor stage onto the UMAP, regardless of cancer type. e) Projection of
metastatic status onto the UMAP. Abbrevs: M0 = non-metastatic tumors, M1 =
metastatic tumors.

**Figure 4: Somatic mutation frequencies for tumors in each class** 
Column uses a logarithmic axis to represent mutation count. Row represents the
tumor samples. Each dot corresponds to the sample mutation count for tumors in
each class, ordered by mutation counts. The median mutation count in each
cluster is indicated by the horizontal line.

**Figure 5: Pan-cancer enrichment of pathway disruptions.** 
a) Waterfall plot; columns represent tumors. Each row represents a pathway. The
pathways are ranked such that the pathway with the most disruptions across all
7,607 tumors is the first row _etc._ and tumors are ordered to prioritize the
top pathway disruptions successively. The top 100 most mutated pathways are
shown. Red signifies pathway disrupted pathways, grey signifies not disrupted.
b) Heatmap shows the relative enrichment of each pathway (columns) within each
numbered cluster (rows). Effect size is displayed as colors (orange, enrichment;
purple, depletion). c) Proportion of mutated samples in the each significant
pathway (columns; union set of pathways with effect size >= 0.30 in each
cluster) within each numbered cluster (rows).

**Figure 6: Gene level analysis reveals tissue-specific class signatures.** 
Odds ratio plot; Column uses a logarithmic axis to represent odds ratio with a
95% confidence interval. Row represents the significant genes from each cluster.
Each cluster was compared against the background (all other clusters) to find
deferentially mutated genes. Significant genes (pvalue < 0.01) were selected and
limited to the top ten results for each clusters. Heatmap; Column represents the
cancer type. Row represents the significant genes as described above. The
heatmap shows the proportion of samples per cluster, per cancer type that is
mutated for each of the significant genes. Depleted significant genes (left).
Enriched significant genes (right).

**Figure 7: ** Comparison of different cancers, simulated and actual results
results. A) To understand the risk model, we plot survival of four simulated
cohorts. Compare survival of a group consisting of randomly selected 30 year old
women (light blue) to an equal sized group of 30 year old women with cancer, k =
2 (light orange). To understand how the mix of ages alters the survival curve,
we compare a randomly selected group of people with ages uniformly distributed
from 30 to 70 (dark blue) and a randomly selected group with uniformly
distributed ages and cancer k = 2 (dark orange). B,C,D,E) We compare a randomly
selected group with correct age distribution for the given cancer (blue) to the
model predicted survival for the given average k (red) and the actual survival
for the patients in our dataset (CHOOSE COLOR HERE, NOT GREEN). As can be seen,
Stomach Cancer (STAD), Glioblastoma (GBM), and Pancreatic Cancer (PAAD) are all
very deadly. The modeled results fit the general trend for the actual patients.
Thyroid Cancer (THCA) on the other hand has very little if any effect on life
expectancy, in fact there may be a slight benefit which may be associated with a
bias in diagnosis towards patients who are more health conscious, or higher
socioeconomic status, with more access to care compared to random population
members.

**Figure 8** Tissue specific effects are compared by showing the probability
density for the posterior value of the $k_{tis}$ multiplier. These values
reflect the general deadliness of the cancer type across all clusters. GBM,
PAAD, and SKCM stand out as having values in the 10 to 20 range with a wide
degree of uncertainty. Other cancers such as Prostate (PRAD) and Thyroid (THCA)
show values down near or even below 1 suggesting that these populations may have
healthier lifestyles and more access to care. Most cancer types fall in the
range 2-7 as might be expected.

**Figure 9** Class specific $k_{class}$ values shown for each cancer type. The
overall $k$ value is the product of $k_{tis} \times k_{class}$. The class
specific value shows the relative aggressiveness of that particular class within
the tissue. For example class 1, 2, and 6 Glioblastoma (GBM) are apparently much
less deadly than other types of GBM. A similar situation can be seen with
Pancreatic Cancer (PAAD) where 1, 6, and 8 are less deadly compared to classes
7, 9, 10. For some cancer types there are few data points and little ability to
estimate values with precision (DLBC and KICH for example).
