If our molecular pathway disruption classes represent distinct biological states
apart from tissue of origin, they may have different prognoses within cancer
types or across all cancers. Kaplan-Meier plots reveal large differences between
cancer types as expected, and some modest differences between our classes (not
shown). These analyses are profoundly limited by confounding factors of age and
stage at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and tissue-specific disease progression, to
name the obvious ones. To explore these ideas, we tested models of survival
using public longevity data from the CDC, accounting for age, gender and
ethnicity. Our model assumes that at birth each person has a small initial
probability per unit time to die, and that this probability per unit time of
death conditional on age, grows exponentially in time at some baseline rate that
matches the observed CDC data. The rate of growth in risk is assumed to jump to
a higher level at diagnosis, which we take as a proxy for onset. This represents
an accelerated aging type model. To fit the model, we constrain the baseline
risks using the available CDC life tables. We then constrain the cancer specific
multiplier using the longevity data within the cancer tumor dataset. Our model
estimates the effect of cancer type and class-specific cancer effects
independently, resulting in a cancer and class specific estimate of the aging
rate multiplier. We found that cancer types, as expected, have a range of
prognoses relative to the general population, as shown in **figure 5a**. The
least deadly was prostate cancer (PRAD), and the most deadly was glioblastoma
(GBM) which has a risk multiplier of between 15 and 22 relative to the
background risk of death in the population. This undoubtedly is due to the fact
that relatively young patients are affected by GBM. Among the deadliest cancers
outside of GBM were stomach (STAD), melanoma (SKCM) and pancreatic (PAAD)
cancers. Apart from these top 4 cancers which ranged from 6-22 in relative risk
of age-adjusted death, the remaining cancer types ranged from about 1 to 5 in
magnitude (**figure 5a**). A rate of 1 represents patients who die relatively
close to the age predicted purely from their demographics independent of the
information that they have the given cancer.

Our estimates of tissue-specific class effects, in contrast, ranged from 0-3,
reflecting that some classes are either less deadly or more deadly than other
classes within each cancer types. A class specific rate of 1 represents typical
rate for this tissue type (**figure 5b**). For several cancers ( _e.g._ PRAD,
kidney chromophobe (KICH), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DBLC), thyroid cancer
(THCA)) the posterior estimates are largely indestinguishable from the prior,
reflecting that either there were too few mortalities in the data to make an
estimate (as expected for PRAD and THCA) or two few samples period. We did not
observe class-specific trends that held true across cancer types, which could
result from different cancers having different standards of care for example. In
support of this interpretation, we also tested a factored model which considered
both cancer type and each class independent of cancer type (**supplementary
figure S7??**). Though we were able to successfully fit this model, it is a
special case of the more general model where class and tissue can independently
affect longevity, and there is no reason to believe that class specific effects
would necessarily remain constant across tissue types given how widely the
patients vary across tissue types as well as the different drug and surgical
treatments typical used for each tissue.
