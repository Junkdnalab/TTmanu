If our molecular pathway disruption classes represent distinct biological states
apart from tissue of origin, they may have different prognoses within cancer
types or across all cancers. Kaplan-Meier plots reveal large differences between
cancer types as expected, and some modest differences between our classes (not
shown). These analyses are profoundly limited by confounding factors of age and
stage at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and tissue-specific disease progression, to
name the obvious ones. To explore these ideas, we tested models of survival
using public longevity data from the CDC, accounting for age, gender and
ethnicity. Our model assumes that at birth each person has a small initial
probability per unit time to die, and that this probability 
grows exponentially in time at some baseline rate that
matches the observed CDC data. The rate of growth in risk is assumed to jump to
a higher level at diagnosis, which we take as a proxy for onset. This represents
an accelerated aging type model. To fit the model, we constrain the baseline
risks using the available CDC life tables. We then constrain the cancer specific
multiplier using the longevity data within the cancer tumor dataset. Our model
estimates the effect of cancer type and class-specific cancer effects
independently, resulting in a cancer and class specific estimate of the aging
rate multiplier. 

To understand the model, we show in **Figure 7A** simulated survival time
curves for four related groups. We start with a cohort of women aged 30 and show
their expected survival (blue). By setting their cancer rate multiplier to $k=2$
we can simulate the effect of a moderately deadly cancer (red). Compare this to
a randomly selected group of women ranging in age from 30 to 70 years old (dark
blue). Immediately the survival curve changes due to the mixture of ages,
without any malignancy. Adding a $k=2$ malignancy further reduces expected
lifespan (dark red). We can see that for different tissues, simply due to the
change in distribution of age-at-diagnosis, we should expect equally deadly
cancers to have *different* survival curves. The model takes this into account
and the aggressiveness of the cancer can be estimated without the confounding
aspect of age.

We found that cancer types, as expected, have a range of prognoses relative to
the general population. For example in **Figure 7B-E** we see three particularly
deadly cancers (Stomach:STAD, Glioblastoma:GBM, and Pancreatic:PAAD), and one
cancer where diagnosis apparently decreases risk relative to background
(Thyroid: THCA). Cancers with posterior probability for relative risk of less
than 1 such as THCA may be those where diagnosis is associated with patients who
have relatively healthy behaviors, are seen regularly by doctors, and comply
with health recommendations.

The degree to which a given cancer accelerates aging can be determined by the
$k_{tis}$ multiplier (**Figure 7F**) multiplied by the class specific modifier
(**Figure 7G**). Looking at the tissue specific multiplier, the least deadly was
prostate cancer (PRAD), and the most deadly was glioblastoma (GBM) which has a
risk multiplier of between 15 and 22 relative to the background risk of death in
the population. This undoubtedly is influenced by the fact that relatively young
patients are affected by GBM and that it is extremely deadly. Among the
deadliest cancers outside of GBM were stomach (STAD), melanoma (SKCM) and
pancreatic (PAAD) cancers. Apart from these top 4 cancers which ranged from 6-22
in relative risk of age-adjusted death, the remaining cancer types ranged from
about 1 to 5 in magnitude. A rate of 1 represents patients who die relatively
close to the age predicted purely from their demographics independent of the
information that they have the given cancer.

Our estimates of tissue-specific class effects, in contrast, ranged from less
than 1 up to about 3 or 4, reflecting that some classes are either less deadly
or more deadly than other classes within each cancer types (**Figure 7G**). A
class specific rate of 1 represents typical rate for this tissue type. For
several cancers ( _e.g._ PRAD, kidney chromophobe (KICH), diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DBLC), thyroid cancer (THCA)) the posterior estimates are largely
indistinguishable from the prior, reflecting that either there were too few
mortalities in the data to make an estimate (as expected for PRAD and THCA) or
two few samples, period. We did not observe class-specific trends that held true
across cancer types, which could result from different cancers having different
standards of care for example. In support of this interpretation, we also tested
a factored model which considered both cancer type and each class independent of
cancer type (not shown). Though we were able to successfully fit this model, it
is a special case of the more general model where class and tissue can
independently affect longevity, and there is no reason to believe that class
specific effects would necessarily remain constant across tissue types given how
widely the patients vary across tissue types as well as the different drug and
surgical treatments typically used for each tissue.
