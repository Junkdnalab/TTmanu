Here we introduce a comprehensive mutational analysis pipeline that uses standardized sequence-based inputs along with multiple types of clinical data to establish correlations among mutation sites, affected genes and pathways, and to ultimately separate the commonly abundant passenger mutations from the truly significant events. In other words, we aim to determine the Mutational Significance in Cancer (MuSiC) for these large data sets. The integration of analytical operations in the MuSiC framework is widely applicable to a broad set of tumor types and offers the benefits of automation as well as standardization. Herein, we describe the computational structure and statistical underpinnings of the MuSiC pipeline and demonstrate its performance using 316 ovarian cancer samples from the TCGA ovarian cancer project. MuSiC correctly confirms many expected results, and identifies several potentially novel avenues for discovery.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gain-of-function mutations often cluster in specific protein regions, a signal that those mutations provide an adaptive advantage to cancer cells and consequently are positively selected during clonal evolution of tumours. We sought to determine the overall extent of this feature in cancer and the possibility to use this feature to identify drivers.
RESULTS: We have developed OncodriveCLUST, a method to identify genes with a significant bias towards mutation clustering within the protein sequence. This method constructs the background model by assessing coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to be under positive selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of somatic mutations to be clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes, which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters. Assessment of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria. This stressed the benefit of combining approaches based on complementary principles to identify driver mutations. We propose OncodriveCLUST as an effective tool for that purpose.

To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600-5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.},

However, these tools do not account for subclasses of cancer genes: oncogenes, which undergo gain-of-function events, and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) which undergo loss-of-function. A method which accounts for these subclasses could improve performance while also suggesting a mechanism of action for new putative cancer genes.
RESULTS: We develop a panel of five complementary statistical tests and assess their performance against a curated set of 99 HiConf cancer genes using a pan-cancer dataset of 1.7 million mutations. We identify patient bias as a novel signal for cancer gene discovery, and use it to significantly improve detection of oncogenes over existing methods (AUROC\,=\,0.894). Additionally, our test of truncation event rate separates oncogenes and TSGs from one another (AUROC\,=\,0.922). Finally, a random forest integrating the five tests further improves performance and identifies new cancer genes, including CACNG3, HDAC2, HIST1H1E, NXF1, GPS2 and HLA-DRB1.

Numerous methods have been developed to identify driver genes, but evaluation of the performance of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard, that is, bona fide driver gene mutations. Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied to driver gene prediction methods. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight such methods. One of these methods, described here, incorporated a machine-learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of the eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the P values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false-positive driver gene predictions. Our analysis points to the strengths and weaknesses of each of the currently available methods and offers guidance for improving them in the future.},

Due to difficulty in modelling distribution of background mutation counts, existing statistical methods are often underpowered to discriminate cancer-driver genes from passenger genes. Here we propose a novel statistical approach, weighted iterative zero-truncated negative-binomial regression (WITER, http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/witer~or KGGSeq,http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/kggseq/), to detect cancer-driver genes showing an excess of somatic mutations. By fitting the distribution of background mutation counts properly, this approach works well even in small or moderate samples. Compared to alternative methods, it detected more significant and cancer-consensus genes in most tested cancers. Applying this approach, we estimated 229 driver genes in 26 different types of cancers. In silico validation confirmed 78\% of predicted genes as likely known drivers and many other genes as very likely new drivers for corresponding cancers. The technical advances of WITER enable the detection of driver genes in TCGA datasets as small as 30 subjects and rescue of more genes missed by alternative tools in moderate or small samples.},

Here, we present driverMAPS (Model-based Analysis of Positive Selection), a model-based approach to driver gene identification. This method explicitly models positive selection at the single-base level, as well as highly heterogeneous background mutational processes. In particular, the selection model captures elevated mutation rates in functionally important sites using multiple external annotations, and spatial clustering of mutations. Simulations under realistic evolutionary models demonstrate the increased power of driverMAPS over current approaches. Applying driverMAPS to TCGA data of 20 tumor types, we identified 159 new potential driver genes, including the mRNA methyltransferase METTL3-METTL14. We experimentally validated METTL3 as a tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer, providing support to the important role mRNA modification plays in tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The molecular complexity of a tumor manifests itself at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Genomic profiling at these multiple levels should allow an integrated characterization of tumor etiology. However, there is a shortage of effective statistical and bioinformatic tools for truly integrative data analysis. The standard approach to integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual integration. A more statistically powerful approach would incorporate all data types simultaneously and generate a single integrated cluster assignment.
METHODS: We developed a joint latent variable model for integrative clustering. We call the resulting methodology iCluster. iCluster incorporates flexible modeling of the associations between different data types and the variance-covariance structure within data types in a single framework, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of the datasets. Likelihood-based inference is obtained through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the iCluster algorithm using two examples of joint analysis of copy number and gene expression data, one from breast cancer and one from lung cancer. In both cases, we identified subtypes characterized by concordant DNA copy number changes and gene expression as well as unique profiles specific to one or the other in a completely automated fashion. In addition, the algorithm discovers potentially novel subtypes by combining weak yet consistent alteration patterns across data types.

We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis.

We found that multiple cancer types have relatively exclusive hub genes individually; however, the hub genes cooperate with each other based on their functional relationship. When we built a protein-protein interaction network of hub genes and found nine functional gene clusters across cancer types, the gene clusters divided not only the region of the network map, but also the function of the network by their distinct roles related to the development and progression of cancer. This functional relationship between the clusters and cancers was underpinned by the high expression of module genes and enrichment of programmed cell death, and known candidate cancer genes. In addition to protein-coding hub genes, non-coding hub genes had a possible relationship with cancer. Overall, our approach of investigating cancer genes enabled finding pan-cancer hub genes and common functional gene clusters shared by multiple cancer types based on the expression status of the primary tumour and the functional relationship of genes in the biological network.},

  abstract = {Reporter gene assays have demonstrated both transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) and transcription-coupled repair, but the net impact of transcription on mutation rate remains unclear, especially at the genomic scale. Using comparative genomics of related species as well as mutation accumulation lines, we show in yeast that the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene. Transcription induces mutagenesis on both DNA strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several TAM mechanisms. A significant positive correlation is also detected between the human germline mutation rate and expression level. These results indicate that transcription is overall mutagenic.},
